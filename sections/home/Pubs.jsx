							Landlord Pubs will be launched initially in the UK and then rolled out worldwide. These will be driven by the $LNDLRD point of sale system providing
							fast, reliable, and cheap crypto payments.

							All Landlord pubs will accept crypto payments and encourage $LNDLRD holders to pay with their tokens to receive discounted drinks. Holders will also be
							able to purchase NFTs that unlock additional drink discounts and special offers.

						<p className="section-desc mb-0">
							Landlord Pubs will use cutting edge technology throughout and help drive crypto mass adoption. Profits will be used to buyback and burn tokens and add
							to liquidity.
